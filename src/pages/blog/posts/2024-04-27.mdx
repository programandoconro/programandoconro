<Post title={title}>





This is a step I have trying for years, ending up depressed at VScode. I have been putting the pieces together, and now, I think I am ready to fly around files and lines of code, as a Neovim Ninja.

Of course I am using vim extension in VScode, but it is not enough for me. There are a lot of functionalities I have no access to, or have limitations. 

But this will be no easy task, these are the requirements for a good code editor in my opinion:

Things I have in VScode that I use all the time
1. Autocomplete 
2. Auto import
3. Go to definition / reference
4. Search word/regex in the whole project
5. Open file from path
6. See git differences before a commit
7. Auto closing tags
8. File explorer and terminal
9. Toggle latest files


If I have all this in VScode, why do I want to migrate? 

Things I know I can have in Neovim:
1. Amazing speed and performance
2. Extreme customizability
3. No need for mouse, hands always over the keyboard 
4. Opportunity to better know my everyday tools
5. Better navigation between files and lines of code
