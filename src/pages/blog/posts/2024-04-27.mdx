<Post title={title}>

This is a step I have trying for years, ending up depressed at VScode. I have been putting the pieces together, and now, I think I am ready to fly around files and lines of code, as a Neovim Ninja.

Of course I am using vim extension in VScode, but it is not enough for me. There are a lot of functionalities I have no access to, or have limitations.

But this will be no easy task, these are the requirements for a good code editor in my opinion:

There are a lot things in VScode that I cannot live without. I will find a similar/better approach in Neovim one by one. These are my top priorities:

1. <a href='#autocomplete'>Autocomplete</a>
2. <a href='#go-to-definition-and-references'> Go to definition and references </a>
3. Search word/regex in the whole project
4. Open file from path
5. See git differences before a commit
6. File explorer and terminal
7. Toggle latest files
8. Rename variable globally
9. Format file on save

Having all these functionalities, I do not think I need to open VScode anymore, while enjoying the Neovim benefits:

- Amazing speed and performance
- Extreme customizability
- No need for mouse, hands always over the keyboard
- Opportunity to better know my everyday tools
- Better navigation between files and lines of code

My plugins are install in 
`/home/ro/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`. You can find them 
<a href='https://github.com/programandoconro/Programming-Locker/blob/master/OS/Linux/Dotfiles/nvim/lua/plugins.lua' target='_blank'> here. </a>

## Autocomplete
This includes auto-importing components, accessing inner properties of an object, knowing what is variables are inside a destructured object, auto-closing tags, and recommending already used words.

For this I used `coc.vim` plugin from <a href='https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim' target="_blank"> here </a>

## Go to definition and references
This is the most important feature for me. I used to surf the project, allowing me to better understand what is happening. This is specially useful when the project is giant (millions lines of code).  

Again, `coc.vim` does the trick. I use a `coc.lua`  file with the keybindings, check it <a href='https://github.com/programandoconro/Programming-Locker/blob/master/OS/Linux/Dotfiles/nvim/lua/coc.lua' target='_blank' style='color: white;'>here.</a>

With these keybindings, I can use `\ gd` and `\ gr` to go to definition and reference respectively.
